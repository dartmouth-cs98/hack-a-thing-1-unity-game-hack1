## Hack-A-Thing-1
### Jasmine Mai, Andrea Jenkins

## Description:
We intended to work on the Hack-A-Thing 1 together, but we ended up following separate tutorials for react-native. Jasmine worked on a unity game and a photo recognition react-native app. 

### Unity Game (in folder called 3D Beginner)
Followed this tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner

Built a 3d game in Unity where the main character has to find his way out of a haunted house. Has moving ghosts and static gargoyles. If they catch you, you lose and have to start over. Added spooky lighting, colliders and rigidbodies on the enemies, and a display plane to display the win/lose messages

* What I learned: Unity, adding lights, adding colliders and rigid bodies, Unity layout, using math, vectors, etc.
* What worked: game is done! 
* What didn't work: Everything went pretty smoothly; I didn't try to add sound.

### Photo Recognition React-Native App (In folder called ReactTutorial)
Followed this tutorial: https://codeburst.io/how-to-build-a-visual-recognition-mobile-app-in-2-days-with-react-native-and-clarifai-3801f0901704 

Built a simple react-native app that brings up an image picker on the click of a button and sends the image to Clarifai to analyze. Displays what the picture is classified as.

* What worked: React Native navigation, image picker
* What didn't work: Connecting with the Clarifai API! Could not figure out why the Clarifai library kept giving back 400s. 
* React-native navigation, a little bit of react-native styling, setting up react-native, using Expo
